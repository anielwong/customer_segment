# Customer Segment Project

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers of a fictitious wholesale retailer, and how to best segment customers into distinct categories using various clustering techniques in order to help the retailer make more informed business decisions.

This project is based on the [Machine Learning Engineer Udacity Course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). 

## Project Highlights
This project is designed to give a hands-on experience with unsupervised learning and work towards developing conclusions for a potential client on a real-world dataset. Many companies today collect vast amounts of data on customers and clientele, and have a strong desire to understand the meaningful relationships hidden in their customer base. Being equipped with this information can assist a company with future products and services that best satisfy the demands or needs of their customers.

Things learned by completing this project:

    How to apply preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and outlier detection.
    How to interpret data points that have been scaled, transformed, or reduced from PCA.
    How to analyze PCA dimensions and construct a new feature space.
    How to optimally cluster a set of data to find hidden patterns in a dataset.
    How to assess information given by cluster data and use it in a meaningful way.

This project contains three files:

    customer_segments.ipynb: This is the main file where the project is performed.
    customers.csv: The project dataset to be loaded in the notebook.
    visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)(v0.17)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

The softwares will need to be installed and ready to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If Python is not installed yet, it is highly recommended to install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

## Starting the Project
In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with the notebook. Alternatively, the command jupyter notebook or ipython notebook can be used and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens.
